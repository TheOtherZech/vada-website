            This website does not knowingly collect any information whatsoever.
            We don't collect it from kids. We don't collect it from adults.
            We don't collect it from you. We don't collect it from your 
            neighbor.  
        </p>

            Will this change in the future? Probably. Will it be anything more
            than some kind of bare-minimum traffic measurement? Probably not.
